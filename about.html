                    <h3>Established Since 2020</h3>
                    <p>Rim Rescue was founded with a simple mission: to provide the highest quality alloy wheel refurbishment and repair services across Reading and Berkshire. What started as a passion for restoring wheels has grown into a trusted business serving hundreds of satisfied customers in Reading and the surrounding areas.</p>
                    
                    <p>We're not a general bodyshop trying to do everything. We focus solely on alloy wheels because that's where our expertise lies. Every day we work with kerb damage, corrosion, diamond cut repairs, and full refurbishments. It's all we do, and we do it properly.</p>
                    
                    <p>Operating from our specialist workshop in Reading, we've invested in professional-grade equipment including diamond cut lathes, powder coating ovens, and the tools needed to deliver factory-quality finishes. But equipment is only part of the story — it's the skill and attention to detail that makes the difference.</p>

                    <h3>Specialist Focus</h3>
                    <p>We only do alloy wheels. No distractions, no side services. This focus means we've seen every type of damage and repair scenario. We know what works and what doesn't, and we apply that knowledge to every job.</p>

                    <p>We don't cut corners on materials. Premium paints, professional-grade lacquers, and proven powder coating systems. The products we use are the same used by major manufacturers. Quality materials mean finishes that last.</p>

                <h2>Why Experience Matters</h2>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card" style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
                <p>Alloy wheel refurbishment isn't just about making things look pretty. There's proper technique involved at every stage.</p>
                
                <p>Wheels need to be structurally sound before any cosmetic work. Damage has to be assessed properly - some wheels can be repaired, others need replacing for safety. The preparation work is critical; rush it and the finish will fail. Different wheel types need different approaches - diamond cut wheels can't just be painted, and powder coating needs specific prep work.</p>
                
                <p>We've learned from experience. We've seen what happens when shortcuts are taken, when inferior materials are used, or when wheels aren't prepared correctly. That's why we insist on doing things the right way, even if it takes longer.</p>
                
                <p>Years of working with alloy wheels means we can spot issues before they become problems, recommend the best repair approach for your situation, and deliver finishes that hold up to real-world use. That experience is what you're paying for, and it's what separates good work from work that fails after a few months.</p>
