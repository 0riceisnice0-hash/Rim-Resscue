Whether you drive a family hatchback, luxury saloon, or performance car, professional refurbishment makes a huge difference.</p>
                
                <h4>The Process:</h4>
                <p>We strip back the old finish, repair any damage, prepare the surface meticulously, and apply a high-quality coating system. Each wheel is inspected at every stage to ensure the finish meets our exacting standards. The result is wheels that look brand new.</p>

            <!-- Diamond Cut Alloy Repair -->
            <div id="diamond-cut" class="service-section">
                <h3>Diamond Cut Alloy Repair</h3>
                <p>Specialist diamond cutting service for precision-machined alloy wheels. Using professional CNC lathes, we recreate that mirror-finish shine that makes premium wheels stand out.</p>
                
                <h4>What This Fixes:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Corrosion on diamond cut faces</li>
                    <li>Lacquer peel and flaking</li>
                    <li>Kerb damage on machined surfaces</li>
                    <li>Oxidation and clouding</li>

                </ul>
                
                <h4>Perfect For:</h4>
                <p>High-end vehicles with diamond cut finish wheels including Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and other premium manufacturers. If your wheels have that distinctive machined face with a clear lacquer coat, this is the service you need. Common on modern alloys from 2010 onwards.</p>
                
                <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
                <p>Diamond cut wheels can't simply be painted over. They require specialist machinery to precision-cut the face of the wheel, recreating the original finish. We use the same process as the factory, ensuring your wheels look exactly as they should. The finish is then protected with high-quality lacquer for long-lasting durability.</p>

            <div id="corrosion" class="service-section">
                <h3>Corrosion and Lacquer Peel Repair</h3>
                <p>Professional repair of corroded wheels and peeling lacquer. UK weather can be brutal on alloy wheels, especially on diamond cut finishes. Salt, moisture, and temperature changes cause lacquer to break down and corrosion to take hold.</p>
                
                <h4>What This Fixes:</h4>
                <ul>

                <h4>Perfect For:</h4>
                <p>Wheels that have been exposed to harsh winter conditions, coastal environments, or have simply aged. Very common on diamond cut wheels from premium German manufacturers. If left untreated, corrosion spreads rapidly and can make wheels unsafe. The earlier you catch it, the better.</p>
                
                <h4>Our Solution:</h4>
                <p>We completely strip the old, failed lacquer and address all corrosion at source. The wheel is prepared properly and refinished with high-quality, durable coatings. This isn't a quick fix that will fail again in six months - we do the job right. The wheels are treated to prevent future corrosion and sealed with professional-grade lacquer that can withstand UK weather conditions.</p>
